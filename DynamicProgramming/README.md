## Exhaustive Search

It solves the same problem as the one implemented in Recursive Processing.

When an array is geven, it determins if it is possible to create target numbers from sum of several elements in the array.

```bash
$ g++ exhaustive_search.cpp
$ ./a.out
5
21 10 7 5 1
4
2 17 4 8
no
yes
no
yes
```

## Fibonacci Number

It returns fibonacci number when the rank is specified.

```bash
$ g++ fibonacci_number.cpp
$ ./a.out
# input is rank of fibonacci numbers
10
# result
